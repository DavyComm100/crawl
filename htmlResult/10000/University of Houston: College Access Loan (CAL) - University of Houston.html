<h2><a name="CALabout"></a>About the Loan</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hhloans.com/index.cfm?objectid=21A41908-C7D3-A868-66FB91774CF078CB">College Access Loan Program (CAL)</a> provides alternative educational loans to students who are Texas residents and are not able to meet their <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/determining-aid/">Cost of Attendance (COA)</a>. The CAL may be used to cover part or all of the student's <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/determining-aid/">Expected Family Contribution (EFC)</a>. The amount of federal aid that a student is eligible for (regardless of whether actually accepted) must be deducted from the COA in determining the CAL loan amount.</p>
