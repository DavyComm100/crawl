<p>Educational loans come from a variety of sources. The federal government, for example, sponsors several loan programs that offer below-market interest rates and other beneficial features. <a href="https://uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/types-aid/loans/ALT/">Other loan options</a>, such as private bank loans, provide valuable help to students who may not qualify for federal loans. Even our own Dean of Students Office offers <a href="../../../payment/plans/index.php#Shortterm">short-term emergency loans</a> to current students.</p>
<p><strong>Our Federal School Code: 003652</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Items to Consider</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Before you take out a loan, make sure you fully understand your options and responsibilities. A student loan can be a valuable tool to help you realize your educational and career dreams, however, it should be the last option you exercise. You should explore and use scholarships, grants, work-study, part-time jobs and family contributions first to finance your education.<br> 2. Don't borrow more than you need or more than you expect to be able to repay. Develop a sound, and realistic, financial plan.<br> 3. Make your loan payments on time, and notify your lender or servicer when you move or change your address.<br> 4. Contact your lender or servicer immediately if you start to have problems repaying your loan. They may be able to provide you with some financing options and give you information about deferments and forbearance.<br> 5. Keep a record regarding your loan. Make copies of letters, canceled checks and any forms you sign. <a href="https://uh.financialaidtv.com/"></a></li>
