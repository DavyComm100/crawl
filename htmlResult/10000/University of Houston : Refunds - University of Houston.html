<p><img alt="Samplecheck of routing number and account number" src="../../_images/image-of-check.png"><br>  <br> Please visit <a href="http://www.allpointnetwork.com/locator.aspx">http://www.allpointnetwork.com/locator.aspx</a> for location of Allpoint network ATM machines near you. The University of Houston and its affiliated offices cannot remove or move funds in any way after they are deposited into your bank account.</p>
<h2>Refund Policy</h2>
<p>Note: Administrative offices are not open on weekends. If the percentage of refund due to a withdrawal changes over a weekend, the student must submit his/her withdrawal to the <a href="http://www.uh.edu/about/offices/enrollment-services/registrar/">Office of the University Registrar</a>, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204-2027 by 5 p.m. the Friday before that weekend in order to obtain the higher percentage of refund.</p>
<p>The effective date recorded for drops or withdrawals will be the date the student drops the course(s) through the Web or the date the drop form or written request is received by the <a href="http://www.uh.edu/about/offices/enrollment-services/registrar/">Office of the University Registrar</a>.</p>
<p>Note: If a credit balance is the result of dropped or withdrawn courses, or due to an overpayment, or due to credit(s) issued on an account, and no financial aid has been received, then a refund will be issued only by requesting that such refund be generated.</p>
<p>Credit balance refunds resulting from the application of excess financial aid will be refunded provided that the eligibility requirements for the receipt of financial aid are being met. Refunds will be disbursed in accordance with the student's refund selection method.</p>
<h2>Withdrawals</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE - Definition of Withdrawal:</strong> Dropping <span><strong>ALL</strong></span> enrolled courses in a single term.<strong><br> For example:</strong> A student who enrolls in a Six Wk 1 course and a Six Wk 2 course is enrolled for <span><strong>ONE</strong></span> Summer Term.</p>
<p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> Refund policy is determined by Texas Statute, not by the university. Your refund will be based on the amount of tuition and fees charged. It is not based on the amount you have actually paid.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> You have enrolled for classes with a total tuition and fee charges of $1000.00 for the semester. You withdraw during the 50% refund period. The university is owed $500.00 at this point in time.<br> a) If you had paid $500.00 at this time, you would receive no refund.<br> b) If you had only paid $300.00 at this time, you would still owe the university $200.00.<br> c) If you had paid $700.00 at this time, then $200.00 would be refunded to you.</p>
