<li>Once students login to the portal, they answer questions that match them to scholarship opportunities for which they are eligible</li>
<li>Students can then easily apply online to multiple scholarship opportunities through the personalized portal</li>
<li>Students can track their application statuses via the portal</li>
<li>Students are alerted whenever they are matched to a new scholarship opportunity</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Award Maximums</strong></p>
<p><span>Any scholarship counts as a financial resource and must be considered when constructing a financial aid award package. <strong>A student’s total financial aid cannot exceed the cost of attendance (COA)</strong>. COA is an estimate of what it costs the typical student to attend the University of Houston. Your COA includes tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation and personal expenses. Exceptions are made for </span> <span>Federal </span> <span>Pell Grant Program recipients, whose financial aid packages can add up to the COA plus the amount of the </span> <span>Federal </span> <span>Pell Grant Program funds. Awards from the University of Houston are subject to change depending on the entire student award package and the student's COA.</span></p>
<p><strong> <span>Scholarship Renewal Requirements</span> </strong></p>
<p><span>Academic Excellence, National Merit, Tier One, and Cullen Leadership Scholarships</span> <span> will renew each year (up to 8 undergraduate semesters, or 10 semesters for architecture students) provided you meet the requirements listed below. These requirements went into effect during the 2018-19 academic year and apply only to students receiving one of the university funded merit scholarships as of Fall 2018 or later. <br> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Enroll in 12 credit hours at <abbr data-markjs="true" title="University of Houston">UH</abbr> each fall and spring semester. Your scholarship funds will not credit to your account if you are enrolled in fewer than 12 credit hours. </span></li>
<li><span>Maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. The GPA calculation only includes courses taken at <abbr data-markjs="true" title="University of Houston">UH</abbr>. <br> </span></li>
<li><span>Complete and pass a total of 30 credit hours by the end of the summer following your first year at <abbr data-markjs="true" title="University of Houston">UH</abbr>, 60 hours by the end of the second year, and 90 hours by the end of the third year. Transfer, AP, and dual credit hours will count toward this requirement.</span></li>
<li><span>Additional details to note:</span> <br>
<ul>
<li><span></span> <span>Transfer hours may be counted toward your total credit hours completed, but they do not count toward your cumulative GPA. </span></li>
<li><span>Credit hours for repeated courses do not count toward the credit hour requirements. If you have AP or dual credit for a course and you take the course at <abbr data-markjs="true" title="University of Houston">UH</abbr>, it is considered a repeat course and will not count toward your credit hour requirements. Your advisor can help you remove AP credit if necessary.</span></li>
<li><span>Courses completed with grades of I, U, W or F are not counted toward the credit hour requirements.</span></li>
<li><span>Summer courses taken at <abbr data-markjs="true" title="University of Houston">UH</abbr> will count toward your credit hours and GPA requirements, but tuition and fees for those courses will not be funded by the scholarship. The University strongly recommends completing your scholarship requirements during the fall and spring semesters.</span></li>
