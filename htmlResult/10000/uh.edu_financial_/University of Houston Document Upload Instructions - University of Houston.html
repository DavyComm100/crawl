<h2><a id="FAQ"></a>FAQs: Financial Aid Document Upload Process</h2>
<p><strong>What are the electronic criteria to upload documents?</strong></p>
<p>The documents must be in .PDF format only, and the file size limit is 25MB per PDF. If you are using the Financial Aid To Do List, documents comprised of multiple pages should be combined into a single PDF file first, and then uploaded. For example, if your tax transcript consists of 6 pages, please scan all 6 of those pages and save it as one PDF file that you can upload into your tax transcript To-Do List. The orientation of the text should match the orientation of the document file (i.e., portrait/landscape). You can upload multiple PDF files if you are using the Task Tile To Do List option.</p>
<p>If you are uploading a verification worksheet form, please ensure that the form is completed in dark ink and is clearly scanned.</p>
<p>If you are using the Financial Aid To Do List, once files are uploaded, the documents cannot be edited by the applicant. Ensure that you are submitting the correct documents for the specified To-Do List item. If you have added an incorrect file, you can navigate to the Task Tile Do List and add the corrected PDF file.</p>
<p>If you do not have access to a scanner, you may use <a href="http://www.uh.edu/infotech/services/facilities-equipment/comp-labs/">services on campus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Can all financial aid documents and forms be uploaded using this service?</strong></p>
<p>Most of our documents can be uploaded using this feature but we do have some documents that are required to be submitted in person. These will be clearly marked on your To-Do List as not uploadable.</p>
<p><strong>Can I include multiple scanned pages within each PDF?</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Financial Aid To Do List, and the documents are in the same group and are comprised of multiple pages, they should be combined into a single PDF file first, and then be uploaded to the appropriate To-Do List item. You can upload multiple PDF files to one To Do List item using the Task Tile To Do List Option. However, if the multiple scanned pages are applicable to multiple To Do List items, you must separate them so that only the correct documents are being uploaded into the appropriate To-Do List item. For example, if you are combining your parents' tax transcript and your tax transcript into one document and uploading it into the Parent Tax Transcript To-Do List item only, this will leave the student tax To-Do List item incomplete. The proper way to address this is to have one PDF file for the parent tax document and another separate PDF file for the student tax documents.</p>
<p><strong>What if I accidentally submitted the wrong document? Can I submit another version?</strong></p>
<p>All versions of the forms submitted must be stored in our imaging service. However, if you want to be able to upload another PDF for the same To-Do List item, navigate to the Task Tile To Do List and attach the correct PDF file making sure to save. You may also contact our office so that a representative can update your To-Do List item to "Incomplete" status. If your To Do List item is currently in a "Received" status, you can still upload the corrected PDF file(s) to that item via the Task Tile To Do List.</p>
<p><strong>How long will my documents take to be processed after I upload them?</strong></p>
<p>The processing time for uploaded verification documents are the same as those being submitted via fax, mail and at the Welcome Center counter. This process can take 3 – 4 weeks and may be even longer during peak times throughout the year. These peak times consist of July, August and September.</p>
<p><strong>May I use my cell phone application to scan documents and save them as a .PDF?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend that students use the most secure and accessible method to scan documents that may contain sensitive information. If the PDF file meets the electronic criteria as listed above, you may use any method to scan the document. <abbr data-markjs="true" title="University of Houston">UH</abbr> does not have a list of recommended smartphone apps for document scanning.</p>
