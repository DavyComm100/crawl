<p>If you're eligible for financial aid at the University of Houston, your financial aid package will possibly include a work-study component, in which you'll take a part-time job to earn money toward your college expenses (and gain valuable job skills, too!).</p>
<p>Work-study jobs go to students with demonstrated financial need, and most students work 12 to 20 hours each week during the academic year. Two programs handle work-study jobs at <abbr data-markjs="true" title="University of Houston">UH</abbr>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Federal Work-Study Program</strong>, which is subsidized by the federal government</li>
<li><strong>The State of Texas College Work-Study Program</strong>, which is subsidized by the State of Texas and restricted to residents of the state of Texas</li>
</ul>
<p>Any scholarship counts as a financial resource and must be considered when constructing a student award package. <strong>Total student aid cannot exceed a student’s cost of attendance.</strong> The cost of attendance (COA) is an estimate of what it costs the typical student to attend the University of Houston. Your COA includes tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation and personal expenses. University of Houston awards are subject to change depending on the entire student award package and the students’ COA.</p></section></div></body></html>
