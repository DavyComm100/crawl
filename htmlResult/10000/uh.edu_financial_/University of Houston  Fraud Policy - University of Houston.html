Commonly falsified items include false claims of independent student status, false claims of citizenship, use of false identities, forgery of signatures of certifications, and false statements of income.</p>
<p>If such intent is suspected on the part of a student, employee or third-party servicer, the case will be referred to the University of Houston's legal council immediately for initial investigation, followed by a formal report made to the OIG.Â  You may be fined up to $20,000, sent to prison, or both.</p>
