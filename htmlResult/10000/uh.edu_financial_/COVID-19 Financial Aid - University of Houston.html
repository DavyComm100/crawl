<p>The University of Houston has been providing emergency grant funding to assist students whose households have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These funds were provided by the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF III) through the American Rescue Plan (ARP).</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid does not employ tax experts and by law cannot answer specific tax questions or help students prepare tax forms. It is the student’s responsibility to meet their tax obligations. We offer this <a href="irs-tax-fact-sheet-2021.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> from the IRS to guide students as they discuss these matters with tax preparers.</p>
<h3>Important information:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Grants are available to degree-seeking students whose households were impacted by COVID-19 anytime since March 13, 2020 and have been enrolled at the University of Houston since March 13, 2020, with preference given to currently enrolled students.</li>
<li>Students must document losses or expenses specifically related to COVID-19 as funds can only be awarded with documentation.</li>
<li>Processing times may take up to six weeks. <strong> <br> </strong></li>
</ul>
