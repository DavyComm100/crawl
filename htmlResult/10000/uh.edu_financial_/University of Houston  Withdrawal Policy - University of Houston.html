<p>For any student who officially or unofficially withdraws from the university or fails to earn a passing grade in any class, federal regulations require a refund calculation for all students receiving Federal Title IV Funds. The calculation of the return of those funds may result in your owning a balance to the university. Also any future aid will be canceled. For any withdrawal prior to the 12th class day, all state and institutional aid will be canceled. Withdrawing from classes will also impact your Satisfactory Academic Progress standing and may cause you to become ineligible for future financial aid. Any changes to your enrollment should be discussed with a financial aid advisor.</p>
<p><strong>Return to Title IV Funds</strong><br> Federal regulations require a refund calculation for all students receiving Federal Title IV Funds who officially or unofficially withdraw from the university.</p>
<p>If you officially withdraw, the length of time during which a refund must be calculated is up to 60 percent of the payment period (semester). If a student withdraws or cancels enrollment on or before the 60 percent point in time, all or a portion of Title IV Funds (Federal Pell Grant Program, Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grant Program, Federal Perkins Loan Program, Federal Direct Subsidized Loan Program, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Program, and Federal PLUS Loans) awarded to a student have to be returned according to provisions of the Higher Educational Act Amendment of 1998. Also, any future aid will be canceled.</p>
<p>If you unofficially withdraw, or stop attending classes without notifying the University, or if you do not earn a passing grade in any class during a semester in which you received financial aid, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid must return all or a portion of aid that was disbursed. If you do not earn a passing grade in any class, the Office Scholarships and Financial Aid will email your professors a request to provide a last date of attendance. The last date of attendance will prove that you participated in an academically related event during the semester in order to show that you earned Title IV aid. A calculation of earned aid will be processed based on the date your professors provide. If a last date of attendance is not provided, 100 percent of aid will be returned. Any return of funds will result in you owing a balance to the University.</p>
