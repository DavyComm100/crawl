<h2><a id="About"></a>About the Loan</h2>
<p>This William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program allows eligible students to borrow loans from Federal Government, which provides low interest rates and beneficial repayment options. The Federal Direct Loan Program include Federal Direct Subsidized Loan, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Federal Parent PLUS Loan and Federal Graduate PLUS loans.</p>
<h2><a id="Interest"></a>Interest Rate and Fees</h2>
<p>Interest is money paid to the lender in exchange for borrowing money. Interest is calculated as a percentage of the unpaid principal amount (loan amount) borrowed. The interest rate varies depending on the loan type and (for most types of federal student loans) the first disbursement date of the loan.

<p>Most federal student loans have loan fees that are a percentage of the total loan amount. The loan fee is deducted proportionately from each loan disbursement you receive. This means the money you receive will be less than the amount you actually borrow. You're responsible for repaying the entire amount you borrowed and not just the amount you received.</p>

<h2><a id="Changes"></a>New Changes/Updates</h2>
<p><strong>Subsidized Stafford Loan Interest Rate<br> </strong> <strong>College Cost Reduction and Access Act</strong></p>
<p>Congress has passed and the President has signed the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, which ties federal student loan interest rates to financial markets. Under this Act, interest rates will be determined each June for new loans being made for the upcoming award year, which runs from July 1 to the following June 30. Each loan will have a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">These rates will apply to all new Federal Direct Loans made during indicated timeframe. Please <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates#rates">click here</a> to view the current interest rates, or <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates#older-rates">click here</a> to view historical Federal Direct Loan interest rate information.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><strong>Subsidized Stafford Loan Grace Period Interest Subsidy</strong><br> <strong>Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Stafford Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) have a grace period during which repayment is not required until six months after the student graduates, withdraws or is enrolled in less than half-time. Previously, Federal Subsidized Stafford Loans maintained the interest subsidy during the grace period. The interest subsidy will no longer be provided during the grace period for first disbursements made on or after July 1, 2012, and before July 1, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>New Limit on Eligibility for Subsidized Stafford Loans</strong><br> <strong>Public Law 112 - 141</strong></p>
<p>A new borrower on or after July 1, 2013, will not be eligible for new Federal Direct Subsidized Loans if the period during which the borrower has received such loans exceeds 150 percent of the published length of the borrower's educational program. The law also provides that a borrower who has reached the 150-percent limit is ineligible for interest subsidy benefits on all Federal Direct Subsidized Loans first disbursed to that borrower on or after July 1, 2013.</p>
<ul>
<li>Borrowers may receive Federal Subsidized Direct Loans for no more than150 percent of the length of the current academic program (i.e., six years for a four-year degree)</li>
<li>Once a borrower has received Subsidized Loans for 150 percent of the length of their program, the borrower's future Federal Subsidized Direct Loan eligibility will end.</li>
<li>A student who has received Federal Subsidized Direct Loans for 150 percent of the length of their program and continues enrollment beyond that point will lose all subsidies on previously received Federal Subsidized Direct Loans. The student also will be required to pay all accumulated interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stafford and PLUS Loan Program Rebate</strong><br> <strong>Budget Control Act of 2011</strong></p>
<p>In Aug. 2, 2011, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which put into place automatic federal budget cuts, known as a “sequester.” While the sequester does not otherwise change the amount, terms or conditions of Federal Direct Loans, the terms of the sequester affect the loan fees charged to Federal Direct Loan borrowers for Federal Direct Subsidized, Federal Direct Unsubsidized and Federal Direct PLUS loans. The amount of the loan origination fee for a loan is determined by the date of the first disbursement of the loan. Any subsequent disbursements, even if made on or after the relevant Oct. 1, have the same loan fee percentage that applied to the first disbursement of that loan.
