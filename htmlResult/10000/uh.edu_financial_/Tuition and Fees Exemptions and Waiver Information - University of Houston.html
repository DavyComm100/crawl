<div><section id="content-well"><p>The University of Houston extends to students any waivers and exemptions for which they qualify. The university reserves the right to evaluate each individual waiver and exemption for compliance with existing regulations and will base any decision on the merit of such review.</p>
<p>Effective Fall 2014, all Texas public institutions of higher education will be required to comply with new legislation passed by the Texas Legislature. Section 54.2001. Continued Receipt of Exemptions or Waivers has been added to the Texas Education Code. In order to continue receiving certain waivers and exemptions, graduate and undergraduate students must now meet the University's grade point average requirement for making satisfactory academic progress toward a degree or certificate, in accordance with the institution's policy regarding eligibility for financial aid. In addition, hours considered excessive under Texas Education Code, Section 54.014 Tuition for Repeated or Excessive Hours, may not be eligible for exemption.</p>
