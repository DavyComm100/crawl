<h2><a id="GRADinterest" name="GRADinterest"></a>Interest Rate and Fees</h2>
<p>Interest is money paid to the lender in exchange for borrowing money. Interest is calculated as a percentage of the unpaid principal amount (loan amount) borrowed. The interest rate varies depending on the loan type and (for most types of federal student loans) the first disbursement date of the loan. Please <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates#rates">click here</a> to view the current interest rates, or <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates#older-rates">click here</a> to view historical Federal Direct Loan interest rate information.</p>
<h2><a id="originationfees"></a>Origination Fees</h2>
<p>Most federal student loans have loan fees that are a percentage of the total loan amount. The loan fee is deducted proportionately from each loan disbursement you receive. This means the money you receive will be less than the amount you actually borrow. You're responsible for repaying the entire amount you borrowed and not just the amount you received.<br><br>Please <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates#fees">click here</a> to view the current loan fees for Federal Direct PLUS Loans.</p>
<h2><a id="GRADdisburse" name="GRADdisburse"></a>Disbursement of Loans</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/disbursement-aid/">Disbursement</a> will begin the first week of classes as long as the student has completed their MPN requirement at <a href="https://studentaid.gov/">StudentAid.gov</a>.<br><br>Once the loan has been disbursed, the funds will be applied to the student's account to cover charges. If a credit balance is created, funds will be refunded according to the student's established refund preference. For more information on refunds, please <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/payment/refunds/">click here</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="GRADmaintenance" name="GRADmaintenance"></a>Maintaining the Loan</h2>
<p>In order to maintain eligibility, a student must be enrolled at least half-time (6 hours for Law/Optometry/Pharmacy/Medical students, and 5 hours for graduate students) at the time of disbursement and meet all <a href="https://uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/satisfactory-academic-progress/">Satisfactory Academic Progress</a> requirements.</p>
<h2><a id="GRADrepayment" name="GRADrepayment"></a>Repayment</h2>
Loans enter into <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/manage-loans">repayment</a> once the funds are fully disbursed (paid out). However, since you are a graduate or professional (Law/Optometry/Pharmacy/Medical) student, your loan will be placed into deferment while you are enrolled at least half-time (6 hours for professional students, and 5 hours for graduate students) and for an additional six months after you cease to be enrolled at least half-time.<br> <br> During the deferment period interest will accrue. You may choose to pay the accrued interest or allow the interest to capitalize when the deferment period ends. Your loan servicer will notify you when your first payment is due.</section></div></body></html>
