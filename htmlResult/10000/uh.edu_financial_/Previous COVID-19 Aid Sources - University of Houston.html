<h3 class="grant"><a id="cares"></a>Federal CARES Act Emergency Grants <span class="label label-info">No longer available</span>  </h3>
<p>Congress established the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) as a part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The fund provides grants to institutions of higher education to assist students with emergency financial aid grants for expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus. </p>
<ul>
<li>The fund may assist students with eligible expenses related to their cost of attendance such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care and childcare.</li>
<li>Funds are available to currently enrolled undergraduate or graduate students, with priority going to students enrolled full time (12 hours for undergraduates, 9 hours for graduate students).</li>
<li>Students’ eligibility will be determined based on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid for the 2019-20 academic year. Potentially eligible students who have not yet filed a FAFSA should do so as soon as possible, but no later than June 29, 2020.</li>
<li>Students who were enrolled exclusively in online programs on March 13, 2020, are not eligible for CARES Act grants.</li>
<li>The University will identify categories of eligible students and determine grant amounts based on reasonable expenses incurred related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19. These automatic grants will range from $225 to $825 with the amount primarily dependent on full- or part-time enrollment status for spring 2020.  </li>
<li>Eligible students who are not funded through one of the identified categories, or funded students whose eligible expenses exceed the initial grant, may submit a CARES Act Grant/Cougar Emergency Fund application for additional consideration.</li>
<li>The award amount for those completing the application is determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the student’s expenses, and is capped at $2,500. Under extreme circumstances, the award may be increased beyond the cap. Funds will be paid to the student through direct disbursement either through a designated bank account or issuance of a check. Students are encouraged to make sure their  <a href="https://www.uh.edu/financial/payment/refunds/">refund preference is up to date or establish a refund preference</a> if they have never done so to receive funds electronically as paper checks can take up to 10 days to be issued.</li>
</ul>

<li>The grant amount is determined on a case-by-case basis, following the formulas required by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB). Students will receive the lesser of:
<ul>
<li>$2500,</li>
<li>the student’s fall financial need minus all gift aid offered at the time the GEER grant is offered,</li>
<li>the sum of the student’s fall tuition, fees and book expenses (limited to $500) minus all gift aid offered at the time the GEER grant is offered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
