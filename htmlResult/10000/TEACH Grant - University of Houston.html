<html><body><div><section class="span8" id="content-well"><p>The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program provides up to $4,000 per year* in grants for graduate and undergraduate students who intend to teach full-time in high-need subject areas for at least four years at schools that serve students from low-income families. Students may receive up to $16,000 for undergraduate study and up to $8,000 for graduate study. Part-time students are eligible, but the maximum grant will be reduced.</p>
<p><strong>*Due to the Budget Control Act of 2011, known as a “sequester,” TEACH Grant awards disbursed on or after Oct. 1 will be reduced by a certain percentage, <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/teach#sequestration">click here</a> for additional information.<br></strong></p>

<h2>TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve and Promise to Pay</h2>
<p>Each year you receive a TEACH Grant, you must sign a <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/launchTeach.action">TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve</a> and Promise to Pay (service agreement) that will be available electronically on the <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/launchTeach.action">Department of Education website</a>. The TEACH Grant service agreement specifies the conditions under which the grant will be awarded, the teaching service requirements, and includes an acknowledgment by you that you understand that if you do not meet the teaching service requirements you must repay the grant as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, with interest accrued from the date the grant funds were first disbursed.</p>
<h2>Teaching Obligation</h2>
<p>To avoid repaying the TEACH Grant with interest you must be a <strong>highly-qualified, full-time</strong> teacher in a <strong>high-need subject area</strong> for at least <strong>four years</strong> at a <strong>school serving low-income students</strong>. You must complete the four years of teaching within eight years of finishing the program for which you received the grant. You incur a four-year teaching obligation for each educational program for which you received TEACH Grant funds, although you may work off multiple four-year obligations simultaneously under certain circumstances. Specific definitions of these terms are included below.</p>
<h2>Highly-Qualified Teacher</h2>
<p>You must perform the teaching service as a highly-qualified teacher who is certified to teach and demonstrates knowledge of the subjects they teach.</p>
<h2>Full-Time Teacher</h2>
<p>You must meet the state’s definition of a full-time teacher and spend the majority (at least 51 percent) of your time teaching one of the high-need subject areas. Elementary teachers who teach many subjects would not be able to fulfill their service agreement.</p>
<h2>High-Need Subject Areas</h2>

<h2>Schools Serving Low-Income Students</h2>
<p>Schools serving low-income students include any elementary or secondary school that is listed in the Department of Education’s <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/tcli.action">Annual Directory of Designated Low-Income Schools for Teacher Cancellation Benefits.</a></p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>You must respond promptly to any requests for information or documentation from the U.S. Department of Education, even if they seem repetitive. These requests will be sent to you while you are still in school as well as once you are out of school. You will be asked regularly to confirm that you either still intend to teach or that you are teaching as required. You must provide documentation to the U.S. Department of Education at the end of each year of teaching.</p>
<p>If you temporarily cease enrollment in your program of study or if you encounter situations that affect your ability to begin or continue teaching, you will need to stay in touch with the U.S. Department of Education to avoid your grants being converted to loans before you are able to complete your teaching obligation.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT REMINDER</strong><br> <strong><em>Failure to complete the teaching obligation, respond to requests for information, or properly document your teaching service will cause the TEACH Grant to be permanently converted to a loan with interest.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Once a grant is converted to a loan it cannot be converted back to a grant!</em></strong></p>
