<p>Educational loans come from a variety of sources. The federal government, for example, sponsors several loan programs that offer below-market interest rates and other beneficial features. <a href="https://uh.edu/financial/graduate/loans/ALT-GRAD/">Other loan options</a>, such as private bank loans, provide valuable help to students who may not qualify for federal loans. Even our own Dean of Students Office offers <a href="https://www.uh.edu/dos/advocacy-support/emergency-loan/">short-term emergency loans</a> to current students. Questions? <a href="http://www.uh.edu/about/offices/enrollment-services/financial-aid/">Contact the Financial Aid Office</a>.</p>
<p>Our Federal School Code: 003652</p>
<h2>Consumer Reporting Agency Notification</h2>
<p>Educational loans are reported to the National Student Loan Database (NSLDS) where they are accessible by authorized agencies, lenders and Higher Educational Institutions. You may access this information by logging on to <a href="https://studentaid.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">StudentAid.gov</a> using your <a href="https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm">FSA ID</a>.</p>
<h2>Loan Options</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/graduate/loans/ALT-GRAD/">Alternative Loans</a></strong><br> If you don't qualify for a federally funded loan like the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you may be able to finance your education with a private loan.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/graduate/loans/Grad-PLUS/">Graduate Federal PLUS Loans</a></strong><br> Graduate Federal PLUS Loans are for graduate/professional degree-seeking students. Borrowers can use the Graduate Federal PLUS Loans to help meet the cost of attendance or cover a student's expected family contribution (the amount of money the government expects the parents and student to provide each year for the student's education).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/types-aid/loans/William-D-Ford-Direct-Loan-Program/">Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans</a></strong><br> Graduate and professional degree-seeking students only qualify for Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans, which begin accruing interest immediately. To be eligible, you must complete a <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/">FAFSA</a>, be enrolled in at least half-time in graduate courses, and have not reached your Federal Direct Loan aggregate limits.</p></section></div></body></html>
