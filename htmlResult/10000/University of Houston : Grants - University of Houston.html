<html><body><div><section class="span8" id="content-well"><p>A grant is a financial award that does not need to be repaid. In other words, it's free money! Grants are typically awarded based on your financial need, unlike <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/types-aid/scholarships/">scholarships</a>, which are usually based on academic excellence.</p>
<p>Grants are available through federal, state, private, and university sources. Funds are limited, so <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply">apply early</a>! You must submit the FAFSA and all other documents by the priority deadline of Jan. 15, unless otherwise indicated, to get maximum consideration for grant funding.</p>

The Federal Pell Grant Program is considered a foundation of federal financial aid, to which aid from other federal and non-federal sources may be added. The maximum Federal Pell Grant Program award for the <span>2022-2023</span> award year (July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023) is $<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW38981634 BCX4">6,</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW38981634 BCX4">895</span>. The maximum award can change each award year and is dependent upon program funding.

You may not receive Federal Pell Grant Program funds from more than one school at a time.</dd>
<dd><br><strong>Federal Pell Grant Program funds initially offered to you are based on an assumed full-time (12 hours) enrollment.</strong> The amount you will actually receive is based on the number of hours you are enrolled in, as of the 12th day of class; the information you provided on the FAFSA, and your lifetime limits already utilized. <strong>Your Federal Pell Grant Program funds will be prorated to reflect your actual enrolled hours after the 12th class day. </strong></dd>
