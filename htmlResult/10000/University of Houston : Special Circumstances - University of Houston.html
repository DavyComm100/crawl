<p class="Default">Federal, state and institutional regulations govern the administration of financial aid programs. Your eligibility is calculated based on all information submitted on your FAFSA. The <a href="http://www.uh.edu/about/offices/enrollment-services/financial-aid/">Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid</a> recognizes that many families experience changes in income or have family situations that are not reflected correctly on the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa">FAFSA</a>. Under federal guidance, we can revise your FAFSA information to reflect your circumstances more accurately.</p>

<h2 class="Default"><a id="dependency"></a>Dependency Status</h2>
<p class="Default"><strong>Are You Independent? </strong>Eligibility for financial aid is based on the premise that <span>your family has the primary responsibility to pay for your education</span>. There are specific guidelines for determining whether you are a dependent or independent student. <i>This is different from your dependency status for tax purposes</i>. To be considered an independent student<strong>, </strong>you have to be able to answer “yes” to at least one of the following questions (and provide documentation if requested):</p>
<ol>
<li class="Default">Are you 24 years old or older?</li>
<li class="Default">As of today, are you married? (Also answer "yes" if you are separated but not divorced.)</li>
<li class="Default">Will you be working on a master's or doctorate program (such as an M.A., M.B.A., M.D., J.D., Ph.D., Ed.D., graduate certificate, etc.)?</li>
<li>Are you currently serving on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces for purposes other than training?</li>
<li>Are you a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces?</li>
<li>Do you have children who will receive more than half of their support from you?</li>
<li>Do you have dependents (other than your children or spouse) who live with you and who receive more than half of their support from you?</li>
<li>At any time since you turned age 13, were both your parents deceased, were you in foster care or were you a dependent or ward of the court?</li>
<li>As determined by a court in your state of legal residence, are you or were you an emancipated minor?</li>
<li>As determined by a court in your state of legal residence, are you or were you in legal guardianship?</li>
<li>In the past year, did your high school or school district homeless liaison determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless?</li>
<li>In the past year, did the director of an emergency shelter or transitional housing program funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless?</li>
<li>In the past year, did the director of a runaway or homeless youth basic center or transitional living program determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless or were self-supporting and at risk of being homeless?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you cannot answer “yes” to any of the above, then you are considered a <strong>dependent student </strong>and the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a> will require your parent(s) information in addition to your own.</p>
<p>Without your parent(s) information, you may still be eligible to receive $2,750 to $3,750 per semester (based on grade level) in a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. You will not be eligible for other federal, state or university need-based aid. Your parent(s) must certify their refusal to provide you with financial support and provide the information requested on the FAFSA. To begin this process, submit a FAFSA with your information only <span class="TextRun Highlight SCXW21969183 BCX4" data-contrast="none" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW21969183 BCX4">and then reach out to a </span></span><a class="Hyperlink SCXW21969183 BCX4" href="https://uh.edu/financial/find-advisor/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span class="TextRun Highlight Underlined SCXW21969183 BCX4" data-contrast="none" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW21969183 BCX4">financial aid advisor</span></span></a><span class="TextRun Highlight SCXW21969183 BCX4" data-contrast="none" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW21969183 BCX4"> to discuss next steps.</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW21969183 BCX4" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":240,"335559739":240,"335559740":259}'> </span></p>
