<p>Your financial aid award(s) are determined by your cost of attendance (COA) and financial need. Need analysis, the process by which we determine your financial need, uses the information from your <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FAFSA</a> and is legislated by the U.S. Congress. If the needs analysis shows that the COA is more than the amount you and your family can contribute, you will qualify for financial aid. The need analysis formula utilizes parents’ and a students’ (or student’s and spouse’s) income, assets, savings, taxes, and other mandatory living expenses to determine the expected family contribution (EFC). In addition, parents’ ages, number of dependents in the household and the dependents enrolled in college also are considered.</p>

<p>You will be notified via e-mail when you have been awarded financial aid. Accept or decline your financial aid award(s) through your <a href="https://accessuh.uh.edu/login.php">myUH self-service account</a>.</p>
<p>The EFC figure is not an actual amount that you (or your parents or spouse) have to pay, but it is an approximation of how much you (and your parents or spouse) should reasonably be able to contribute toward your educational expenses.</p>
