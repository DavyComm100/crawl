<p>Summer 2023 aid is based on the 2022-2023 <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAFSA</a> information. If you have not completed the 2022-2023 <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAFSA</a>, you must complete it by June 30, 2023 to be considered for summer aid.</p>
<p>Summer financial aid is available for students who are enrolled for the summer term and have remaining aid that was not utilized during the prior fall and spring terms. The summer term is the final term in the academic year at the University of Houston. Therefore, if a student has completed the FAFSA for fall and/or spring, the application also includes the following summer. Students enrolled for summer courses will be evaluated for summer aid by the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid starting the end of April. Students should finalize their summer enrollment by April 30. Notification of summer aid eligibility will be emailed to students at the email address on file. Students should update contact information in their <a href="http://accessuh.uh.edu">myUH self-service account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Current Students <br> </strong>Students who attended the University of Houston (main campus) during the fall and/or spring term will only need to register for summer classes; no additional application form is needed. Students enrolling in repeat courses for the summer are encouraged to read the Financial Aid <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/maintaining-eligibility/Repeat-Course-Policy-For-Financial-Aid.pdf">Repeat Course Policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer Students</strong> <br>Students new to the University for the spring or summer term will need to complete a <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/forms/#summertransfermonitor">Summer Transfer Monitor</a> form if it is initiated on their <a href="http://accessuh.uh.edu">myUH</a> To-Do List. A student’s eligibility and enrollment will determine the awarding of summer financial aid.</p>
<p><strong>Verification Deadline</strong> <br>If you are selected for verification, the <abbr data-markjs="true" title="University of Houston">UH</abbr> Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will notify you via email regarding any additional information that is needed or any changes to your aid offer due to verification. Any requested information is “initiated” in your <a href="http://accessuh.uh.edu">myUH</a> To-Do List and is required to process your financial aid application. To allow time for accurate processing, the deadline to submit documents to <abbr data-markjs="true" title="University of Houston">UH</abbr> for Summer 2023 financial aid is June 16, 2023. You must already have an official EFC, as a result of completing a <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAFSA</a>, processed by the U.S. Department of Education in order to submit any requested documents to our office.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you purposely provide false or misleading information, you will be reported to the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Education, and may be subject to a fine, sentenced to jail or both.</p>
<strong>Summer Awards</strong> <br>Limited amounts of institutional grant assistance may be available to students who demonstrate financial need, however, funds are limited and will be awarded based on date order of summer registration. In addition, two types of federal funding sources are available for summer via the FAFSA, based on remaining eligibility: Federal Pell Grant Funds and student loans. Students also may apply for <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/types-aid/loans/ALT/">private loans</a> with their lender.
<p><strong>Federal Pell Grant Program <br> </strong>Students eligible for the Federal Pell Grant Program can receive up to 150 percent of their scheduled Federal Pell Grant each year. This means that if you received Federal Pell Grant Program funds for both fall and spring terms, you may qualify for Federal Pell Grant Program funds for the summer.</p>
<p>If you enrolled full-time (12+ hours) and received your full-time Federal Pell Grant for fall and spring, you must enroll in at least half-time (6 hours) for the summer term to be offered summer Federal Pell Grant Program funds. You must have <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell/calculate-eligibility">lifetime Pell Grant eligibility</a> remaining in order to qualify for these additional funds. Being enrolled less than half-time will result in cancellation of summer Federal Pell Grant Program funds.</p>
<p><strong>Federal Direct Loans <br> </strong>Students’ summer loan eligibility is based on their remaining annual loan eligibility for loans received at <abbr data-markjs="true" title="University of Houston">UH</abbr> or another institution during the academic year. Students who received their annual loan limit the past fall and spring terms no longer have loan eligibility for the summer term. Federal Direct Loans require at least half-time enrollment (6 credit hours for undergraduate/law/optometry/pharmacy/medical students, 5 credit hours for graduate students). Students who alter their enrollment after being awarded will need to complete a <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/forms/#revisionrequest">Revision Request form</a> requesting an aid adjustment. Federal Direct Loans will be canceled for students who are enrolled less than half-time.</p>
<p>Please note that students may not receive federal aid from multiple institutions during the same enrollment period. This would result in cancellation of aid and a resulting balance due to the University.</p>
<p><strong>Annual and aggregate (career) Federal Direct Loan limits are as follows:</strong> <strong> </strong></p>
