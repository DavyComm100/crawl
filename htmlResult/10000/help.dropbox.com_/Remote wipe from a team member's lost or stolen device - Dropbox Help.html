<p>Admins can remote wipe all team files from a specific team member’s device. This is recommended if a team member is no longer on your team, or if their device is lost or stolen. </p>
<p><a href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/delete-dropbox-device?fallback=true" class="js-qwynlraxz">Learn more about remote wipe or how to remote wipe a device if you’re a team member or on a Plus, Family, or Professional plan.</a></p>
<p><b>Note: </b>This only deletes their team account and files. If they <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/multiple-accounts/link-unlink-two-accounts?fallback=true" class="js-qwynlraxz">linked a personal account,</a> it doesn’t delete those files.</p>
<p>To remote wipe files from a team member’s device:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/login" class="js-qwynlraxz">Sign in</a> to dropbox.com with your admin credentials.</li>
<li>Click on <b>Admin Console</b> in the left sidebar.</li>
<li>Click <b>Members</b>.</li>
<li>Click the name of the member whose files you want to remote wipe.</li>
<li>Under <b>Devices</b>, click the <b>X</b> next to the device you'd like to remove.</li>
<li>Check <b>Delete files from [Organization name] Dropbox the next time this computer comes online</b><ul>
<li>If you don’t see this, and the device is a phone or tablet, move on to the next step. Files can’t be synced to phones and tablet, even if they’re made available offline, so there’s no need to remote wipe them. If you follow these steps, you’re still removing access to the files in the account with that device by remotely signing the team member out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click <b>Sign out</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note: </b>If they have the Dropbox Paper app installed, you can also <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/files-folders/paper/admin-settings-business-teams#device?fallback=true" class="js-qwynlraxz">sign them out of the Paper app remotely</a>, which would remove access to their files from the device.</p>
<h2>Check the remote wipe status of team member files</h2>
<p>To check the remote wipe status of the files:</p>
