<p>When you share a file or folder using Dropbox, the recipient receives an email with a link to the file or folder. The recipient must have a Dropbox account and be signed into that account to view or edit the file or folder. If the recipient doesn’t have a Dropbox account, or doesn’t want to sign in to view it, you can <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/share/create-and-share-link" target="_blank"><u>share it with a view-only link instead</u></a>.</p>
<p>You can control whether people <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/share/folder-view-only-permissions" target="_blank"><u>can edit or can only view</u></a> your files and folders when you share them and even after you share them. Edits and comments made to a shared file or folder are updated live for everyone they’ve been shared with. Learn how to manage your default sharing settings.</p>
<p><b>Notes: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you're on a Dropbox team account and you share a folder with your teammates, the folder is automatically added to their Dropbox accounts.</li>
<li>If you share a folder with an individual Dropbox user, the user needs to manually add the folder to their Dropbox account.</li>
<li>Anyone who is invited to collaborate in a file or folder can create their own link to share with others.
</li>
</ul>
