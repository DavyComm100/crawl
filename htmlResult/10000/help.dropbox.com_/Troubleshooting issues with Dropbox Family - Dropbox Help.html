<h2>Invite not available</h2>
<p>If you’ve received an invite to a Dropbox Family plan and are unable to accept the invitation, review the “invite not available” error messages below to help resolve your issue.</p>
<p><b>You’re already a member of this plan.<br>
</b>You may have already joined the Dropbox Family plan you were invited to. To check:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Sign in</a> to dropbox.com.</li>
<li>Click your avatar (profile picture or initials) in the top-right corner.</li>
<li>Click <b>Settings</b>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Plan.</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>You can’t be a member of more than one Family plan.<br>
</b>Your email address can only be associated with one Dropbox Family plan. If you’d like to join another Family plan, you’ll need to use a different email address and Dropbox account. </p>
<p><b>Before you can join the plan, you’ll need to cancel your existing subscription from your mobile device.<br>
</b>If you have a subscription that was purchased on a mobile device through an app store, you’ll need to <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/cancellations-refunds/cancel-mobile?fallback=true">cancel your existing plan</a> and downgrade to Dropbox Basic. You’ll be able to join the Family plan at the end of your current billing cycle—you won’t lose access to any files when you downgrade.</p>
<p><b>Your current plan doesn't support switching to the Family plan.</b><br>
If your subscription was <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/payments-billing/promotion-license-key?fallback=true" target="_blank">redeemed from a license key</a>, you won’t be able to switch to Dropbox Family with that account. If you’d like to buy or join a Dropbox Family plan with the same account, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/support" target="_blank">contact support</a> and downgrade to a Basic plan first. </p>
<p><b>Your account currently has extended version history, which isn't supported in Dropbox Family.</b><br>
If you’ve purchased <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/files-folders/restore-delete/extended-version-history?fallback=true" target="_blank"><u>extended version history</u></a>, you won’t be able to switch to Dropbox Family with that account. If you’d like to buy or join a Dropbox Family plan with the same account, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/support" target="_blank">contact support</a> and downgrade to a Basic plan first.</p>
<p><b>You are not allowed to join the plan. <br>
</b>Access to Dropbox plans is <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/restricted-access-region-country?fallback=true">restricted in certain countries and regions</a>. If you’re in a restricted location, you won’t be able to join Dropbox Family.</p>
<p><b>You’re signed in with a Dropbox Business account.<br>
</b>If you’re signed in to a Dropbox Business account, you won’t be able to accept an invitation to Dropbox Family. Ask the person who invited you to resend the invitation to your personal email address. Once you receive the invitation, you can either create a new free Basic account when you join the plan, or join with an existing Dropbox Basic, Plus, or Professional account.</p>
<p><b>Before you can join the plan, you’ll need to cancel your scheduled downgrade.<br>
</b>If you’ve scheduled a downgrade to your Dropbox Plus or Professional account, you’ll need to cancel the downgrade before you can accept your Family plan invite. After you join Dropbox Family, your account will be refunded for the prorated cost of your original plan.</p>
<p><b>You can’t join the plan at this time. <br>
</b>There may be a problem with your invitation. Refresh the page to try again. If you continue to receive this message, ask the person who invited you to check the status of your invite.</p>
