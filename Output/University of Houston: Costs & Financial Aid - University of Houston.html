<h3 class="financial-section">About Costs &amp; Financial Aid  </h3>
<p>Concerned about paying for your education at the University of Houston? Think of it as an investment in your future. Whether you're an undergraduate or a graduate student, a UH education will pay for itself many times over in higher earnings and expanded opportunities throughout your life.</p>
<p>What’s more, we award a wide range of scholarships, fellowships and other financial aid to graduate and undergraduate students alike. With our generous financial assistance packages, some UH students find that their actual cost is lower than they had originally expected. Trying to determine your tuition and fee bill for future semesters? Take a look at the estimated <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/tuition-fees/">Tuition Calculator</a> for estimates based on hours of enrollment and major. We invite you to explore the financial information provided here. We look forward to helping you invest in your future! Please contact the <a href="http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/">Financial Aid</a> office for your federal and state aid processing, and please contact <a href="http://www.uh.edu/about/offices/enrollment-services/student-business-services/">Student Business Services</a> for payment, fee bill calculation, refund, deferment and book loan processing.</p>
