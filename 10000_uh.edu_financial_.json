The amount of the loan origination fee for a loan is determined by the date of the first disbursement of the loan. Any subsequent disbursements, even if made on or after the relevant Oct. 1, have the same loan fee percentage that applied to the first disbursement of that loan.

We will determine the actual amount you may borrow.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus/parent#interest\">interest rate for Federal Direct PLUS Loans</a> is fixed. Interest is charged on Federal Direct PLUS Loans during all periods, beginning on the date of your loan's first disbursement. To find out more information on interest rates for Federal Direct PLUS Loans, please <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates\">click here.</a></p>\n<p>In addition to interest, you pay a loan origination fee that is a percentage of the principal amount of each Federal Direct PLUS Loan that you receive. This fee helps reduce the cost of making these low-interest loans. We deduct the fee before you receive any loan money, so the loan amount you actually receive will be less than the amount you have to repay.</p>\n<p>Dependent students whose parents have applied for but were unable to get a PLUS Loan are eligible to receive additional Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds.</p>\n<h2><strong><a id=\"Application\"></a>Application for Loans</strong></h2>\n<p>Eligibility Requirements<br> <br> Student/Child must,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>be a dependent undergraduate student;</li>\n<li>be enrolled in at least half-time with established financial need;</li>\n<li>be enrolled in an undergraduate degree program (certification programs are not eligible for financial aid);</li>\n<li>have completed a <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/\">FAFSA</a> and be eligible to receive federal financial aid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To take out a Federal PLUS Loan for the first time, the parent must complete a Federal PLUS Loan Application and master promissory note (MPN) online at the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/mpn/parentplus/landing\">StudentAid.gov website</a>. The MPN is a legal document in which you promise to repay your loan(s) and any accrued interest and fees to the Department. It also explains the terms and conditions of your loan(s).</p>\n<p>A parent may complete the MPN electronically, you can do so online at the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/mpn/parentplus/landing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">StudentAid.gov website</a>. If you are borrowing Federal Direct PLUS Loans for more than one student, you'll need to complete a separate MPN for each one. To complete an MPN online, you will be required to use your Department of Education-issued <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing\">FSA ID</a> (not your child's). If you do not have a FSA ID, you may request one from the <a href=\"http://pin.ed.gov/PINWebApp/pinindex.jsp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch\">official FSA ID site</a><a href=\"http://pin.ed.gov/PINWebApp/pinindex.jsp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>.</p>\n<p>In most cases, once you've submitted the MPN and it's been accepted, you won't have to fill out a new MPN for future loans you receive to pay for the educational expenses of the same student. You can borrow additional Federal PLUS Loans on a single MPN for up to 10 years at the same school.</p>\n<p>You'll receive a disclosure statement that gives you specific information about any loan that the school plans to disburse under your MPN, including the loan amount and loan fees, and the expected loan disbursement dates and amounts.</p>\n<h2><strong><a id=\"Credit\"></a>Credit Check &amp; Endorser Alternative</strong></h2>\n<p>To be eligible for a Federal PLUS Loan, the parent must not have an adverse credit history, which the Department of Education will check for when you apply for the loan. If you are found to have an adverse credit history, you may still borrow a Federal PLUS Loan if you get an endorser who does not have such a history. An endorser is someone who agrees to repay the loan if you do not. The endorser may not be the student on whose behalf a parent obtains a Federal PLUS Loan. In some cases you may also be able to obtain a Federal PLUS Loan if you document to our satisfaction that there are extenuating circumstances related to your adverse credit history.</p>\n<p>In addition, parents and their dependent child must be U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens, must not be in default on any federal education loans or owe an overpayment on a federal education grant, and must meet other general eligibility requirements for the Federal Student Aid programs. You can find more information about these requirements he <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/h/understand-aid\">Federal Student Aid website</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong><a id=\"Disbursement\"></a>Disbursement of Loans</strong></h2>\n<p>Once the Federal PLUS loan application has been processed by our office and MPN received, <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/disbursement-aid/\">disbursement</a>\u00a0will begin during the first week of classes. When funds have been disbursed, they will be applied to the student's account to cover charges. If a credit balance is created, funds will be refunded to the student's <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/payment/refunds/\">refund</a> preference.</p>\n<h2><strong><a id=\"Maintenance\"></a>Maintenance of Loans</strong></h2>\n<p>In order to maintain eligibility, students must be enrolled at least half-time at the time of disbursement and meet all <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/satisfactory-academic-progress/\">Satisfactory Academic Progress</a> requirements.</p>\n<h2><strong><a id=\"Repayment\"></a>Repayment of Loans</strong></h2>\n<p>There is no grace period for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan \u2014 the repayment period begins 60 days after your school makes the last disbursement of the loan. However, if you're a parent Federal PLUS Loan borrower who is also a student, you can defer repayment while you're enrolled in school at least half time and (for Federal Direct PLUS Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008) for an additional 6 months after you graduate or drop below half-time enrollment.</p>\n<p>If you're a parent Federal PLUS Loan borrower, you can defer repayment of Federal Direct PLUS Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008, while the student for whom you obtained the loan is enrolled at least half time, and for an additional 6 months after the student graduates or drops below half-time enrollment (half-time enrollment status is determined by your child's school). You must separately request each deferment period.</p>\n<p>Generally, you'll have from 10 to 25 years to repay your loan, depending on the repayment plan that you choose. You can choose to repay your Federal PLUS Loan using the standard, extended, or graduated repayment plan.\u00a0<a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus/parent#repayment-plans\">Read more about these repayment plans</a>.</p>\n<p>Your loan servicer will notify you of the date your first payment is due. If you do not choose a repayment plan, your loan servicer will place you on the standard plan, with fixed monthly payments for up to 10 years. Most Federal Direct Loan borrowers choose to stay with the standard repayment plan, but there are other options for borrowers who may need more time to repay or who need to make lower payments at the beginning of the repayment period.</p>\n<p>You can change repayment plans at any time by contacting your loan servicer.</p>\n<p><strong>Consolidation</strong></p>\n<p>If you have multiple federal education loans, you can consolidate them into a single Direct Consolidation Loan. This may simplify repayment if you are currently making separate loan payments to different loan holders, as you'll only have one monthly payment to make. There may be tradeoffs, however, so you'll want to learn about the advantages and possible disadvantages of consolidation before you consolidate. To learn more, visit the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/app/launchConsolidation.action\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Direct Consolidation Loan website</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Automated payments (electronic debit)</strong></p>\n<p>When you receive your first bill, you'll learn how to sign up for the electronic debit account (EDA) option and have your bank automatically make your monthly loan payments for you from your checking or savings account. You won't have to write checks, use stamps, or worry if your payment will get to us by the due date. In addition, there is a 0.25 percent reduction in the interest rate on your loans during any period when your payments are made through EDA.</p>\n<p><strong>Trouble making payments</strong></p>\n<p>If you're having trouble making payments on your loans, contact your loan servicer as soon as possible. Their staff will work with you to determine the best option for you. Options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing repayment plans.</li>\n<li>Deferment, if you meet certain requirements. A deferment allows you to temporarily stop making payments on your loan.</li>\n<li>Forbearance, if you don't meet the eligibility requirements for a deferment, but are temporarily unable to make your loan payments. A forbearance allows you to temporarily stop making payments on your loan, temporarily make smaller payments, or extend the time for making payments. Read more about <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/lower-payments/get-temporary-relief/forbearance\">deferments and forbearance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you stop making payments and don't get a deferment or forbearance, your loan could go into default, which has serious consequences (see below).</p>\n<p>Your loan becomes \"delinquent\" if your monthly payment is not received by the due date. If you fail to make a payment, we'll send you a reminder along with the servicer of your loans that your payment is late. If your account remains delinquent, we'll send you warning notices reminding you of the consequences of default and of your obligation to repay your loans.</p>\n<p>If you are delinquent on your loan payments, contact your loan servicer immediately to find out how to bring your account current. Late fees may be added, and your delinquency will be reported to one or more national consumer reporting agencies (credit bureaus), but this is much better than remaining delinquent on your payments and going into default.</p>\n<p><strong>Consequences of default</strong></p>\n<p>If you default:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be required to immediately repay the entire unpaid amount of your loan.</li>\n<li>The Department of Education may sue you, take all or part of your federal and state tax refunds and other federal or state payments, and/or garnish your wages so that your employer is required to send us part of your salary to pay off your loan.</li>\n<li>You will be required to pay reasonable collection fees and costs plus court costs and attorney fees.</li>\n<li>You may be denied a professional license.</li>\n<li>You will lose eligibility for other federal student aid and assistance under most federal benefit programs.</li>\n<li>You will lose eligibility for loan deferments.</li>\n<li>Your default status will be reported to the national consumer reporting agencies (credit bureaus).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information and to learn what actions to take if you default on your loans, see the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/default\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Student Aid website for Understanding Delinquency and Default.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uh.financialaidtv.com/\"><img alt=\"fatv1\" class=\"\" src=\"../../../../../about/offices/enrollment-services/web-images/getanswers-ad-banner-ga06-uh.png\"></a></p>\n<p>\n</p></section></div>"

Don't borrow more than you need or more than you expect to be able to repay. Develop a sound, and realistic, financial plan.<br> 3. Make your loan payments on time, and notify your lender or servicer when you move or change your address.<br> 4.

Financial aid is defined as \u201canticipated or pending aid\u201d until it actually \"disburses\" into a student\u2019s account. When we \"disburse\" your financial aid, we credit your pending financial aid awards to your balance due.</dd>\n<dt>When will financial aid disburse to my student financial account?</dt>\n<dd>Financial aid is awarded to students' accounts as pending/anticipated aid prior to the start of each term. All institutional scholarships and loans will begin disbursing the first week of classes (this can be delayed if you have session courses that start in months other than August and January). All Grants will disburse after the 12th class day of your latest enrolled session which is referred to as the \"official reporting date\" (ORD). This allows students to make changes to their enrollment status prior to the Official Reporting Day without adversely affecting their financial aid status. To view the specific disbursement dates for the semester, please visit out <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/disbursement-aid/\">disbursement page</a>.

This difference is shown in your myUH self-service account under \"Account Summary.\" For example, let's say you have semester \"Charges Due\" due of $2,000, and your accepted pending/anticipated financial aid amount is $1,000. At that time, the amount you would need to pay in order to secure your classes would be $1,000; therefore, your \"Account Summary\" would show $1,000. Students are always advised to check their myUH financial accounts daily during the start of each term as balances and financial aid is subject to adjustment at any time.</dd>\n<dd></dd>\n<dd>\n<p><a href=\"es_reviewingyouraccount.pdf\"><strong>Learn how to view pending/anticipated aid and total amount due in AccessUH &gt;</strong></a></p>\n</dd>\n<dt>What can I do if I do not have enough funds to cover my total term balance?</dt>\n<dd>Prior to the University payment due date, students can select one of three payment plans offered by the University in order to secure enrollment: <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/payment/plans/index.php#Emergency\">90-Day Emergency Deferment Plan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/payment/plans/index.php#Emergency\">Short-Term Tuition Deferment Plan (45 Day)</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/payment/plans/index.php#IPP\">Installment Pay Plan</a>.

In the absence of evidence of a last day of attendance at an academically related activity, the school must consider a student who failed to earn a passing grade to be an unofficial withdrawal and subject to returning 100 percent of financial aid received for the semester.</dd>\n<dt><strong>How will Financial Aid obtain the information to complete an unofficial withdrawal for me?</strong></dt>\n<dd>The Office Scholarships and Financial Aid will email your professors a proof of course completion request on the business day following the grade deadline for the term. They will be asked to provide the last date of attendance via an email reply. All emailed responses from professors must be received within 10 days of email receipt.</dd>\n<dt><strong>How much will be returned to the Department of Education?</strong></dt>\n<dd>A date of withdrawal will be determined according to the last date of attendance the professor has provided. That date will be used to calculate the Return of Title IV (R2T4) and federal funds to return. If the professor indicates that the student stopped attending but we cannot provide a specific date, then we will use the midpoint of the semester and calculate the R2T4 based on 50 percent. Students who withdraw (officially or unofficially) after completing 60 percent of the semester earn 100 percent of their financial aid for the semester and no Title IV funds are returned. If a last date of attendance is not provided by the deadline, 100 percent of federal aid received for the semester will be returned.</dd>\n<dt><strong>How am I notified if I owe a balance due to withdrawal?</strong></dt>\n<dd>Once the unearned aid is established, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will reduce the award and a send a letter of notification to the student. Official correspondence from the University is sent to the email address provided by the student. If the student has failed to correct his or her contact information, they will not be relieved of the responsibility on the grounds that the correspondence was not received. The unearned aid is removed from the student\u2019s account by Scholarships and Financial Aid and returned to the Department of Education through the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) system. Any unearned Title IV financial aid is returned by University of Houston in the following order: Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Federal Direct Subsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Federal Pell Grant Program funds, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program (SEOG) funds, other Title IV assistance.</dd>\n<dt><strong>If aid is returned, will I owe the University?</strong></dt>\n<dd>If the Return of Title IV (R2T4) calculation causes a balance on the account, it is the student's responsibility to pay the balance to the University of Houston. Students are required to repay any balance owed to the University of Houston before transcripts or diplomas will be released or before students can register for an upcoming semester. Any federal loan amount owed by the student is to be repaid under the terms of their promissory note; in addition, students may be responsible for possible repayment of grant funds to the Department of Education</dd>\n<dt><strong>Does withdrawing affect Satisfactory Academic Progress?</strong></dt>\n<dd>Yes, withdrawing from one or all classes may impact your Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP).

If you have not completed the 2022-2023\u00a0<a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FAFSA</a>, you must complete it by June 30, 2023 to be considered for summer aid.</p>\n<p>Summer financial aid is available for students who are enrolled for the summer term and have remaining aid that was not utilized during the prior fall and spring terms. The summer term is the final term in the academic year at the University of Houston. Therefore, if a student has completed the FAFSA for fall and/or spring, the application also includes the following summer. Students enrolled for summer courses will be evaluated for summer aid by the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid starting the end of April. Students should finalize their summer enrollment by April 30. Notification of summer aid eligibility will be emailed to students at the email address on file. Students should update contact information in their <a href=\"http://accessuh.uh.edu\">myUH self-service account</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Students <br> </strong>Students who attended the University of Houston (main campus) during the fall and/or spring term will only need to register for summer classes; no additional application form is needed. Students enrolling in repeat courses for the summer are encouraged to read the Financial Aid <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/maintaining-eligibility/Repeat-Course-Policy-For-Financial-Aid.pdf\">Repeat Course Policy</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Transfer Students</strong> <br>Students new to the University for the spring or summer term will need to complete a <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/forms/#summertransfermonitor\">Summer Transfer Monitor</a> form if it is initiated on their <a href=\"http://accessuh.uh.edu\">myUH</a> To-Do List. A student\u2019s eligibility and enrollment will determine the awarding of summer financial aid.</p>\n<p><strong>Verification Deadline</strong> <br>If you are selected for verification, the <abbr data-markjs=\"true\" title=\"University of Houston\">UH</abbr> Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will notify you via email regarding any additional information that is needed or any changes to your aid offer due to verification. Any requested information is \u201cinitiated\u201d in your <a href=\"http://accessuh.uh.edu\">myUH</a> To-Do List and is required to process your financial aid application. To allow time for accurate processing, the deadline to submit documents to <abbr data-markjs=\"true\" title=\"University of Houston\">UH</abbr> for Summer 2023 financial aid is June 16, 2023. You must already have an official EFC, as a result of completing a <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FAFSA</a>, processed by the U.S. Department of Education in order to submit any requested documents to our office.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you purposely provide false or misleading information, you will be reported to the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Education, and may be subject to a fine, sentenced to jail or both.</p>\n<strong>Summer Awards</strong> <br>Limited amounts of institutional grant assistance may be available to students who demonstrate financial need, however, funds are limited and will be awarded based on date order of summer registration. In addition, two types of federal funding sources are available for summer via the FAFSA, based on remaining eligibility: Federal Pell Grant Funds and student loans. Students also may apply for <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/types-aid/loans/ALT/\">private loans</a> with their lender.\n<p><strong>Federal Pell Grant Program <br> </strong>Students eligible for the Federal Pell Grant Program can receive up to 150 percent of their scheduled Federal Pell Grant each year. This means that if you received Federal Pell Grant Program funds for both fall and spring terms, you may qualify for Federal Pell Grant Program funds for the summer.</p>\n<p>If you enrolled full-time (12+ hours) and received your full-time Federal Pell Grant for fall and spring, you must enroll in at least half-time (6 hours) for the summer term to be offered summer Federal Pell Grant Program funds. You must have <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell/calculate-eligibility\">lifetime Pell Grant eligibility</a> remaining in order to qualify for these additional funds. Being enrolled less than half-time will result in cancellation of summer Federal Pell Grant Program funds.</p>\n<p><strong>Federal Direct Loans <br> </strong>Students\u2019 summer loan eligibility is based on their remaining annual loan eligibility for loans received at <abbr data-markjs=\"true\" title=\"University of Houston\">UH</abbr> or another institution during the academic year. Students who received their annual loan limit the past fall and spring terms no longer have loan eligibility for the summer term. Federal Direct Loans require at least half-time enrollment (6 credit hours for undergraduate/law/optometry/pharmacy/medical students, 5 credit hours for graduate students). Students who alter their enrollment after being awarded will need to complete a <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/forms/#revisionrequest\">Revision Request form</a> requesting an aid adjustment. Federal Direct Loans will be canceled for students who are enrolled less than half-time.</p>\n<p>Please note that students may not receive federal aid from multiple institutions during the same enrollment period.

See instructions below for solutions to size file greater than 25MB. (For converting images and .doc files to PDF, follow the instructions below [an adobe Acrobat writer is required to convert files to .pdf])</p>\n<p>If your PDF file size is too big\u00a0\u2013 try one of the following solutions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Scan document at a lower resolution</li>\n<li>Scan document in Black &amp; White</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/reduce-pdf-file-size\">Three Ways to reduce PDF files </a></li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<h2><a id=\"FAQ\"></a>FAQs: Financial Aid Document Upload Process</h2>\n<p><strong>What are the electronic criteria to upload documents?</strong></p>\n<p>The documents must be in .PDF format only, and the file size limit is 25MB per PDF. If you are using the Financial Aid To Do List, documents comprised of multiple pages should be combined into a single PDF file first, and then uploaded. For example, if your tax transcript consists of 6 pages, please scan all 6 of those pages and save it as one PDF file that you can upload into your tax transcript To-Do List. The orientation of the text should match the orientation of the document file (i.e., portrait/landscape).\u00a0You can upload multiple PDF files if you are using the Task Tile To Do List option.</p>\n<p>If you are uploading a verification worksheet form, please ensure that the form is completed in dark ink and is clearly scanned.</p>\n<p>If you are using the Financial Aid To Do List, once files are uploaded, the documents cannot be edited by the applicant. Ensure that you are submitting the correct documents for the specified To-Do List item.\u00a0If you have added an incorrect file, you can navigate to the Task Tile Do List and add the corrected PDF file.</p>\n<p>If you do not have access to a scanner, you may use <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/infotech/services/facilities-equipment/comp-labs/\">services on campus</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Can all financial aid documents and forms be uploaded using this service?</strong></p>\n<p>Most of our documents can be uploaded using this feature but we do have some documents that are required to be submitted in person. These will be clearly marked on your To-Do List as not uploadable.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I include multiple scanned pages within each PDF?</strong></p>\n<p>If you are using the Financial Aid To Do List, and the documents are in the same group and are comprised of multiple pages, they should be combined into a single PDF file first, and then be uploaded to the appropriate To-Do List item. You can upload multiple PDF files to one To Do List item using the Task Tile To Do List Option. However, if the multiple scanned pages are applicable to multiple To Do List items, you must separate them so that only the correct documents are being uploaded into the appropriate To-Do List item. For example, if you are combining your parents' tax transcript and your tax transcript into one document and uploading it into the Parent Tax Transcript To-Do List item only, this will leave the student tax To-Do List item incomplete. The proper way to address this is to have one PDF file for the parent tax document and another separate PDF file for the student tax documents.</p>\n<p><strong>What if I accidentally submitted the wrong document? Can I submit another version?</strong></p>\n<p>All versions of the forms submitted must be stored in our imaging service. However, if you want to be able to upload another PDF for the same To-Do List item,\u00a0navigate to the Task Tile To Do List and attach the correct PDF file making sure to save. You may also contact our office so that a representative can update your To-Do List item to \"Incomplete\" status. If your To Do List item is currently in a \"Received\" status, you can still upload the corrected PDF file(s) to that item via the Task Tile To Do List.</p>\n<p><strong>How long will my documents take to be processed after I upload them?</strong></p>\n<p>The processing time for uploaded verification documents are the same as those being submitted via fax, mail and at the Welcome Center counter. This process can take 3\u00a0\u2013 4 weeks and may be even longer during peak times throughout the year. These peak times consist of July, August and September.</p>\n<p><strong>May I use my cell phone application to scan documents and save them as a .PDF?</strong></p>\n<p>We recommend that students use the most secure and accessible method to scan documents that may contain sensitive information. If the PDF file meets the electronic criteria as listed above, you may use any method to scan the document. <abbr data-markjs=\"true\" title=\"University of Houston\">UH</abbr> does not have a list of recommended smartphone apps for document scanning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#Top\">Back to Top</a></p></section></div>"

The TEACH Grant service agreement specifies the conditions under which the grant will be awarded, the teaching service requirements, and includes an acknowledgment by you that you understand that if you do not meet the teaching service requirements you must repay the grant as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, with interest accrued from the date the grant funds were first disbursed.</p>\n<h2>Teaching Obligation</h2>\n<p>To avoid repaying the TEACH Grant with interest you must be a <strong>highly-qualified, full-time</strong> teacher in a <strong>high-need subject area</strong> for at least <strong>four years</strong> at a <strong>school serving low-income students</strong>. You must complete the four years of teaching within eight years of finishing the program for which you received the grant.

In 2001, the Texas Legislature passed a bill that states that these students may be eligible for state grants. Eligible students MUST meet certain criteria provided in the legislation to be considered for Senate Bill 1528 status.</p>\n<p>Students who are not U.S. Citizens, U.S. legal permanent residents, or <a href=\"http://studentaid.ed.gov/eligibility/non-us-citizens\">eligible noncitizens</a> do not qualify for federal financial assistance to pay for college.</p>\n<p>Under HB 1403/SB1528 students are eligible to receive a variety of forms of state financial aid, but first must submit the University of Houston's electronic <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/senate-bill-1528/#TASFAforms\">Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA)</a>.</p>\n<p>As of Oct. 1, 2022, students can submit an electronic 23-24 TASFA by utilizing the University of Houston\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://uhsnapprod.regenteducation.net/\">eTASFA portal</a>.<br><br>Students and/or their parents must provide important information about their family's income and expenses every year. The University of Houston will use this application to determine how much state financial aid the student is eligible for. Please note that availability of funds is very limited, submitting an application does not guarantee eligibility. Students are encouraged to complete the application and upload all requested documentation by the <strong>Jan. 15</strong> priority deadline each year to be considered for maximum funding.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"beforeyouapply\"></a>Before you Apply</h2>\n<p>To be eligible to apply for state financial aid you must meet the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must not be eligible to apply for federal aid through the <a href=\"http://www.collegeforalltexans.com/index.cfm?objectid=A3119543-CBF8-C202-F1B0EEFD5F4B9805\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a></li>\n<li>Have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED) Certificate</li>\n<li>Be classified as a Texas resident (Note that a nonresident who pays a resident rate due to a tuition waiver is not a resident for the purpose of this application)</li>\n<li>Be enrolled for a minimum of nine hours in a degree-seeking program</li>\n<li>Be registered with the Selective Service if required (males only)</li>\n<li>Maintain <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/satisfactory-academic-progress/\">Satisfactory Academic Progress</a></li>\n<li>Submit a <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/undergraduate-admissions/apply/residency/Affidavit-Approved-2013.pdf\">Residency Affidavit</a> to the Office of the University Registrar. *(Please note: This form is for admitted students only. If you have not graduated high school, your submitted form will stay in pending status until your final\u00a0high school transcript is received by the Admissions Office. We encourage you to fill out the TASFA even if your Residency Affidavit is pending.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have determined that you are eligible, you are ready to begin the six steps to apply for state financial aid.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"stepsforapplicants\"></a>Steps for State Applicants</h2>\n<p><strong>Step 1: File Taxes<br> </strong> The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires you (and your spouse) and/or your parents to file a tax return if either you (or your spouse) and/or your parents meet the income thresholds established annually by the IRS. For more information regarding income thresholds, go to <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/\">www.irs.gov</a>. Request an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN): Individuals who do not have a Social Security Number can apply for an ITIN using a W-7 Tax Form. For more information, go to <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/\">www.irs.gov</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Register with the Selective Service (males only)<br> </strong> If you are a male between the ages of 18 and 25, you must register with the Selective Service. You can obtain a registration form at your local post office or at <a href=\"https://www.sss.gov/Forms\">sss.gov/forms</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Complete your TASFA<br> </strong>Submit the e-TASFA by <a href=\"https://uhsnapprod.regenteducation.net/\">clicking here</a>. If you have not used the e-TASFA portal before, you will need to create an account to be able to submit your electronic application. If you previously created an account, you can sign in using the same credentials. Once you have completed and submitted the online application, you will be notified via email to submit any additional documents, which may include tax transcripts, selective service registration, and/or additional forms. You will also see the required documents listed in your <a href=\"https://accessuh.uh.edu/login.php\">myUH self-service</a> To-Do List. These documents should be submitted by uploading them to each To-Do List item. Please <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/sfaupload/\">click here</a> for instructions on how to upload documents.</p>\n<p>Additional documents requested may include one or more of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proof of registration with Selective Service (males only). You may upload a copy of the registration acknowledgement card.</li>\n<li>A copy of your income tax transcript(s) for the requested year. If you (and your spouse) and/or your parents are required to file taxes, we will not process your TASFA until you upload a copy of all tax returns or IRS tax transcripts. If income was earned but a tax return was not submitted, please upload all W-2s for the requested tax year.</li>\n<li>Order a free copy of tax return transcript. To order one, go to <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov\">www.irs.gov</a> or call 1-800-908-9946.</li>\n<li>You must complete and submit the <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/senate-bill-1528/#TASFAforms\">TASFA</a> to our office and upload any additional documents requested by the priority deadline of <strong>Jan. 15</strong>, to receive the maximum consideration for limited financial aid resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Complete Your File if additional documentation is required<br> </strong> This program is awarded according to availability of funds.\u00a0Applicants are awarded in order that they submit and/or complete their applications.</p>\n<p>While processing your TASFA, additional documentation may be requested to complete your application. You will be notified via email if your file is incomplete. Be sure you monitor your To-Do List online in your <a href=\"https://accessuh.uh.edu/login.php\">myUH</a> self-service account. <strong>The priority deadline to submit all requested documents is Jan. 15</strong>.</p>\n<p>If we have requested additional documents, your completion date will be the date on which you submitted the last required document.</p>\n<p>For example: Scott submits his TASFA in November but has required, initiated To Do List items that were requested in December. He uploads his parents' tax return transcript and all other required documents in December, but does not upload a copy of his Selective Service Registration Card until March. In this example, he would not be considered complete until March, at which time his file would be updated and submitted for review, but only after submitting all necessary documents.</p>\n<p>In certain cases, we may initiate required documents via your To Do List after the Jan. 15 priority deadline, if you submitted your initial application by Jan. 15 and you did not have any pending items at that time, you will still be considered for priority funding. However, you must submit any required documents as soon as possible to complete your file to be offered any state aid.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Check Your Status<br> </strong> In order to be eligible for state assistance, you MUST be a fully admitted, degree-seeking student. Check your status online in your <a href=\"https://accessuh.uh.edu/login.php\">myUH</a> self-service account.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6: Accept Your Awards<br> </strong> We will notify you via email when you have been awarded financial aid.

        "content": "<div><section id=\"content-well\"><p>Questions about the financial aid process at <abbr data-markjs=\"true\" title=\"University of Houston\">UH</abbr>? Check here for answers. If your question isn't addressed here, feel free to <a href=\"https://uh.edu/about/offices/enrollment-services/financial-aid/\">contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do I have to make Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) to receive financial aid? </strong> <br> Federal law requires that schools administering federal aid set a minimum academic performance standard in order to continue to receive financial aid. A school must monitor a student\u2019s qualitative (GPA) and quantitative (course completion) performance. The federal standards require a 2.0 cumulative GPA, 67 percent cumulative completion ratio, and total hours not to exceed 150 percent of the program.</p>\n<p><strong>If I am not making academic progress and am denied my aid, may I still receive my Federal Direct Loans?</strong> <br> No, SAP is calculated for all federal programs administered by the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid at the University of Houston, including Federal Direct Loans.</p>\n<p><strong>What will cause my appeal to be rejected or denied?</strong> <br> If your appeal is not completed, properly signed, and if no corroborating documents are included, your appeal is considered incomplete. Students who miss the deadline or fail to turn in additional requested documents in a timely fashion will be denied. We encourage students to submit a thoughtful and well-worded typed statement, as this reflects on your commitment towards improving academic performance.</p>\n<p><strong>What do quantitative and qualitative measurements mean?</strong> <br> Qualitative measurements refer to your cumulative GPA.</p>\n<p>Quantitative measurements monitor:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Percentage of courses completed: the number of courses you successfully completed versus the total number of courses you attempted.</li>\n<li>Total attempted hours: the total number of courses you enrolled in to receive your degree.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Will my transfer credit count toward the quantitative measure of my academic performance?</strong> <br> Yes, the law requires that we consider all course work accepted by the University in our calculations of the ratio of courses completed and cumulative hours. However, transfer credits will not help improve your cumulative GPA at <abbr data-markjs=\"true\" title=\"University of Houston\">UH</abbr>.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a deadline to submit a SAP appeal?</strong> <br>Yes, to be eligible to appeal a loss of financial aid eligibility, students must submit both a <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a> <strong>and</strong> a complete financial aid <a href=\"https://uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/forms/index.php#sap\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAP appeal.</a>\u00a0Students will receive an email sent to their destination email address providing the SAP appeal deadline. This deadline will also be posted on the SAP appeal form.\u00a0 <strong>Students who are not meeting SAP and do not meet the printed deadline will not have their financial aid SAP appeals considered for the current term.</strong> These students may appeal for the next term.</p>\n<p><strong>If I am not meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress, will I be dropped by the fee payment deadline due to non-payment?</strong> <br> Students whose appeals are not received by the appeal submission deadline date are subject to being dropped from their classes due to non-payment, if they have not selected <a href=\"https://uh.edu/financial/payment/plans/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> a payment or deferment plan</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How long after my appeal is approved will my financial aid funds be released?</strong> <br> If your appeal is approved prior to the first day of classes and you have fulfilled all disbursement requirements, loans will begin to apply within the first week of classes. If your appeal is approved after the first day of classes and you have fulfilled all disbursement requirements, your funds will be applied within five business days from the approval of the appeal. Remember that Federal Direct Loans require at least 6 credit hours of enrollment and completion of the Entrance Counseling and Master Promissory Note at <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/h/complete-aid-process\">StudentAid.gov</a>.</p>\n<p>Grants will disburse the day after the Official Reporting Day, typically the thirteenth day of the semester. Remember that certain grants require minimum enrollment (i.e., 9 credit semester hours for TEXAS Grant).</p>\n<p><strong>When will my appeal be reviewed?</strong> <br> We strongly encourage that you submit your completed SAP appeal as soon as possible to give the committee ample time to review it. Appeals will be reviewed within four (4) weeks of submission. If you submitted an incomplete SAP appeal and then turn in additional documents, it may take an additional four (4) weeks to process the documents submitted later. It is best to turn in a complete appeal with all corroborating documents by the deadline.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do I submit my Appeal Form?</strong> <br> Appeals can be uploaded via your <a href=\"https://accessuh.uh.edu/login.php\">myUH</a> self-service account To Do List, faxed to our office at (713) 743-9098 or submitted in person to the SFA counter in the Welcome Center. When uploading your documents, please save all pages as one PDF for uploading. Visit <a href=\"https://uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/sfaupload/\"><abbr data-markjs=\"true\" title=\"University of Houston\">uh</abbr>.edu/sfaupload</a> for instructions on how to use the To Do List upload feature. We encourage you to <a href=\"https://uh.edu/financial/find-advisor/\">visit with an advisor</a> to have your initial appeal reviewed for completion.</p>\n<p><strong>How many times can I submit an appeal? <br> </strong> You are only allowed to appeal once during your academic career until you are able to meet SAP again. Students who appeal, but fail to meet cumulative academic standards after the probation semester will lose their ability to appeal again, unless mitigating circumstance exist, and must pay out of pocket. Please contact the office to learn more about the mitigating appeal. You may be selected to turn in a SAP plan if we have deemed that it may take you more than one semester to cumulatively improve your academic performance. Once you meet cumulative standards, you regain your financial aid eligibility. If after regaining eligibility, you fail to meet SAP requirements again, you may submit another SAP appeal.</p>\n<p><strong>What if I meet SAP requirements during the year?</strong> <br> A student who meets SAP requirements during the year should contact Scholarships and Financial Aid for a review of their eligibility.</p></section>\n</div>"

The calculation of the return of those funds may result in your owning a balance to the university. Also any future aid will be canceled. For any withdrawal prior to the 12th class day, all state and institutional aid will be canceled. Withdrawing from classes will also impact your Satisfactory Academic Progress standing and may cause you to become ineligible for future financial aid. Any changes to your enrollment should be discussed with a financial aid advisor.</p>\n<p><strong>Return to Title IV Funds</strong><br> Federal regulations require a refund calculation for all students receiving Federal Title IV Funds who officially or unofficially withdraw from the university.</p>\n<p>If you officially withdraw, the length of time during which a refund must be calculated is up to 60 percent of the payment period (semester). If a student withdraws or cancels enrollment on or before the 60 percent point in time, all or a portion of Title IV Funds (Federal Pell Grant Program, Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grant Program, Federal Perkins Loan Program, Federal Direct Subsidized Loan Program, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Program, and Federal PLUS Loans) awarded to a student have to be returned according to provisions of the Higher Educational Act Amendment of 1998. Also, any future aid will be canceled.</p>\n<p>If you unofficially withdraw, or stop attending classes without notifying the University, or if you do not earn a passing grade in any class during a semester in which you received financial aid, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid must return all or a portion of aid that was disbursed. If you do not earn a passing grade in any class, the Office Scholarships and Financial Aid will email your professors a request to provide a last date of attendance. The last date of attendance will prove that you participated in an academically related event during the semester in order to show that you earned Title IV aid. A calculation of earned aid will be processed based on the date your professors provide. If a last date of attendance is not provided, 100 percent of aid will be returned. Any return of funds will result in you owing a balance to the University.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uh.financialaidtv.com/\"><img alt=\"fatv1\" class=\"\" src=\"../../../../about/offices/enrollment-services/web-images/getanswers-ad-banner-ga28-uh.png\"></a></p>\n<p>\n</p></section></div>"

All other graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA.</p>\n<h3>Quantitative Requirements of Satisfactory Academic Progress</h3>\n<p>Percentage of attempted cumulative hours completed \u2013 Complete and pass a minimum of 67percent of the hours attempted at the University of Houston.</p>\n<h3>Maximum Timeframe</h3>\n<p>Federal regulations require that a student complete his program of study within 150 percent (length of program x 1.5) of the time allotted for the program. For example, if an undergraduate degree is 120 credit hours in length, a student with this major must complete the program within 180 (120 x 1.5) credit hours. All credit hours attempted at the University of Houston, including repeated courses with a grade of \u201cF\u201d, \u201cW\u201d, \u201cI\u201d, or \u201cIP\u201d, and all transfer hours to be used toward a degree at the University of Houston that were pursued at a previous institution, will be counted in the determination of hours attempted. After attempting 180 credit hours, the student\u2018s financial aid eligibility will be terminated for this program.</p>\n<h3>Students Who Receive All Failing Grades</h3>\n<p>If a student does not receive a passing grade in any class (earning any combination of \"F\"s, \"W\"s and \"U\"s), or stops attending classes without notifying the University during a semester in which he/she received financial aid, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (SFA) must return all or a portion of aid that was disbursed. Official documentation proving that the student participated in an academically related event during the semester will be requested in order to show that the student earned Title IV aid. A calculation of earned aid will be processed based on acceptable documentation. If no acceptable documentation is provided, 100 percent of aid will be returned. Any return of funds will result in the student owing a balance to the University.</p>\n<h3>Possible Categories Assigned after SAP is calculated:</h3>\n<p><strong>Meets SAP</strong> <br> A status assigned to a student who has met minimum SAP requirements. <br> <br> <strong>Not Meets</strong></p>\n<p>A status of \u201cNot Meets\u201d is assigned to a student who is currently not meeting SAP federal standards for any of the following categories \u2013 cumulative completion ratio, cumulative GPA, and not exceeding 150 percent of hours needed to complete the program. Students who have a semester of all F, W's, NR's for their only grades and I's will impact their completion ratio for the following SAP evaluation period.</p>\n<p>Students not meeting SAP will be placed on financial aid suspension and are not eligible to receive further funding. Students have the right to appeal their suspension by submitting a <a href=\"https://uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/forms/#sap\">SAP Appeal</a> form with supporting documentation to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid by the printed deadline. Students whose appeals are approved must make academic progress and return to SAP good standing within one probationary term. Students who do not meet the requirements will have all further financial aid suspended until they do.</p>\n<h3>Appeal Process</h3>\n<p>Students who are placed on financial aid suspension may submit an appeal to reinstate eligibility. An appeal must be submitted to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (SFA) before aid can be disbursed in future semesters. Appeals must be completed by the student. <span> <strong>A personal statement and corroborating documents as listed on the second page of the SAP form MUST be submitted in order to be considered as a complete submission</strong> </span>. A student can submit the appeal and mandatory additional documents in person at the Financial Aid Counter in Welcome Center, Room 120, by fax at (713) 743-9098, or by upload feature. We encourage students to submit their completed SAP appeal online using the upload feature within the To-Do List (PDF format only) by 5 p.m. on the deadline date listed on the appeal form. Students may also be required to complete a SAP Academic Plan for future semesters.</p>\n<p>If submitted appeal documents are incomplete or lack corroborating documents, your review and decision process could be delayed or denied. Regardless of method of submission, please make sure that the myUH ID number is on the top right-hand corner of every page. The appeal forms are available in the <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/forms/#sap\">Forms section</a> of this website as well as in the Welcome Center office. Please follow the deadlines as listed on the SAP appeal form. If the student's appeal is denied, he/she will be responsible for covering the balance for that semester. <strong>The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will provide an initial review and response to the student's appeal before the University payment due date if the student submits a complete appeal and all supporting documents by the priority deadline.</strong></p>\n<strong>Tips for Submitting the SAP Form <br> <br> </strong>\n<p>1. Read your Financial Aid To-Do List descriptions and the SAP form thoroughly. Please be sure to check off and sign where required. Incomplete forms will be denied. <br> <br> 2. Please put in effort toward answering the questions for your personal statement (Section II of the SAP form) and be sure to include documentation to support your statement. For example, if Adam performed poorly in the fall due to excessive work hours, Adam should discuss this situation in his personal statement, and include a copy of his work schedule from that time. If Adam has now prioritized his academics and made adjustments to reduce his work hours, Adam can also include a copy of his new work schedule to demonstrate the adjustment. <br> <br> 3. We encourage students to combine their appeal and corroborating documents into one PDF file and upload it to their To-Do List to save time waiting in line. However, please consider that submitting the forms at our Financial Aid counter in the Welcome Center will allow for an initial review by an advisor, who can then counsel you on any incomplete portions of the appeal. This review process is not available online if you upload your file.</p>\n<p><strong>Process For Those Who Have Already Been Denied</strong></p>\n<p>If a student fails to meet SAP standards despite prior SAP approvals or academic plans, and consequently loses financial aid eligibility, the student may submit a written appeal with supporting documentation for reinstatement of financial aid eligibility, <strong>only if mitigating circumstances exist</strong>. <br> <br> Mitigating circumstances include: <br> \u2022\u00a0Serious injury of the student and/or the student's immediate family <br> \u2022\u00a0Serious extended illness of the student and/or the student's immediate family <br> \u2022\u00a0Death of student's relative</p>\n<p><strong>Appeal Process For Not Meets Status</strong> <br> Students who are placed on financial aid suspension may appeal to re-establish eligibility.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Academic Suspension</strong> \u2013 Academic suspension is determined by the <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/about/offices/enrollment-services/registrar/\">Office of the University Registrar</a>. Students may not appeal for financial aid until the academic suspension is lifted. An approval on an academic appeal does not automatically mean the student will be granted approval on a financial aid appeal.\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n<li>A student not meeting SAP standards must submit a <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/forms/#sap\">Financial Aid Appeal Form</a> with supporting documentation to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid by the printed deadline in order to receive consideration for financial aid eligibility. Failure to provide supporting documentation will result in the denial of an appeal. Students appealing their suspension must pay their own expenses until the appeal is reviewed. After an appeal has been reviewed and has been denied, the student must continue to pay his/her own expenses.</li>\n<li>Students who submit their SAP appeal by the priority deadline as noted on the SAP form will receive a decision on their appeal before the University payment due date. Students who submit their appeal after the priority deadline and before or on the final deadline will have their appeal reviewed <strong> <em>within four weeks of its receipt and determine whether the financial aid suspension is justified</em> </strong>. Students will be notified of appeal decision via the destination email address, as noted in the myUH self-service center.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Financial Aid SAP Appeal Form is available on our <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/forms/#sap\">SFA forms webpage</a>. Appeals can be uploaded online, faxed to our office at (713) 743-9098 or dropped off to our SFA counter in the Welcome Center.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uh.financialaidtv.com/\"> <img alt=\"fatv1\" class=\"\" src=\"../../../../about/offices/enrollment-services/web-images/getanswers-ad-banner-ga28-uh.png\"> </a></p>\n<p>\n</p></section>\n</div>"

Interest is calculated as a percentage of the unpaid principal amount (loan amount) borrowed. The interest rate varies depending on the loan type and (for most types of federal student loans) the first disbursement date of the loan.

The loan fee is deducted proportionately from each loan disbursement you receive. This means the money you receive will be less than the amount you actually borrow. You're responsible for repaying the entire amount you borrowed and not just the amount you received.<br><br>Please <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates#fees\">click here</a> to view the current loan fees for Federal Direct PLUS Loans.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"GRADdisburse\" name=\"GRADdisburse\"></a>Disbursement of Loans</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/financial/undergraduate/how-apply/disbursement-aid/\">Disbursement</a> will begin the first week of classes as long as the student has completed their MPN requirement at <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/\">StudentAid.gov</a>.<br><br>Once the loan has been disbursed, the funds will be applied to the student's account to cover charges. If a credit balance is created, funds will be refunded according to the student's established refund preference.

However, since you are a graduate or professional (Law/Optometry/Pharmacy/Medical) student, your loan will be placed into deferment while you are enrolled at least half-time (6 hours for professional students, and 5 hours for graduate students) and for an additional six months after you cease to be enrolled at least half-time.<br> <br> During the deferment period interest will accrue. You may choose to pay the accrued interest or allow the interest to capitalize when the deferment period ends. Your loan servicer will notify you when your first payment is due.</section></div>"
